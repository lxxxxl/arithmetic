# arithmetic
Qt Android app for teaching children arithmetic

Application uses opensource cliparts from [lpenz](https://openclipart.org/artist/lpenz)


### Text to speech
To use QTextToSpeech functionality on linux system you should install some additional packages and start `speech-dispatcher` daemon:
```
sudo apt install espeak speech-dispatcher qtspeech5-speechd-plugin
speech-dispatcher -d
```
On Android TTS works fine.
